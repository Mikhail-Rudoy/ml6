In order to run this program, you need to run the command "python main.py <arguments>" where <arguments> is a list of filenames of our graphics scripts. The edge and master transformation matrices carry over between the files if the command q is not used. If it is used, the two matrices are restarted and the code skips to the next filename in the list.

The command "make run" will run "python main.py example.txt"
