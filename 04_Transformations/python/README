"make" to compile files
"make example" to run example
"make clean" or "make clear" to remove compiled files and tilda files

suggested uses:
"python main.py <arguments>" (see below)
"make example clean"
"make example clear"

In order to run this program, you need to run the command "python main.py <arguments>" where <arguments> is a list of filenames of our graphics scripts. The edge and master transformation matrices carry over between the files if the command q is not used. If it is used, the two matrices are restarted and the code skips to the next filename in the list.

The command "make example" runs (among other things) "python main.py example.txt"
