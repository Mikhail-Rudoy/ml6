"make" to compile files
"make example1" to run example1 script
"make example2" to run example2 script
"make clean" or "make clear" to remove compiled files and tilda files

suggested uses:
"python main.py <arguments>" (see below)
"make example1 clean"
"make example1 clear"
"make example2 clean"
"make example2 clear"

In order to run this program, you need to run the command "python main.py <arguments>" where <arguments> is a list of filenames of our graphics scripts. The edge and master transformation matrices carry over between the files if the command q is not used. If it is used, the two matrices are restarted and the code skips to the next filename in the list.

The command "make example" runs (among other things) "python main.py example.txt"
