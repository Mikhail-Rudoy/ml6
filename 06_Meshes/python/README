"make" or "make compile" to compile files
"make example" to run example script
"make clean" or "make clear" to remove compiled files and tilda files

suggested uses:
"python main.py <arguments>" (see below)
"make example clean"
"make example clear"

In order to run this program, you need to run the command "python main.py <arguments>" where <arguments> is a list of filenames of our graphics scripts. The edge and master transformation matrices carry over between the files if the command q is not used. If it is used, the two matrices are restarted and the code skips to the next filename in the list.

The command "make example" runs (among other things) "python main.py example.txt"

- the script files are simple text files following a particular format
- every command is a seperate line
- any arguments necessary for a command are found on the next line seperated by spaces
- any unrecognized command is ignored and all commands are single letter words, so comments can be easily included
the following is a list of commands and their uses

q (quit) --0 arguments--
>>> end script

i (identity) --0 argumets--
>>> convert the transformation matrix into an identity matrix

w (wipe) --0 arguments--

a (apply) --0 arguments--
>>> apply the transformation matrix to the edge matrix

l (line) --6 arguments--
>>> adds a line segment to the edge matrix
