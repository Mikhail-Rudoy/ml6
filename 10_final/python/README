Run this with 
python main.py
or
python main.py <script>

make will run python main
make example will run the example script
make clean will clean the directory
make clear will clean the directory (will also delete ppm and gif files)

The example (together with all the required commands) works. However, I did things a certain way that is slightly different from the norm. I will document my script specs here eventually. For now, stick with the example script.
